However, those experienced in navigation saw plainly that if any accident had occurred, it was not to the vessel herself, for she bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled, the anchor a-cockbill, the jib-boom guys already eased off, and standing by the side of the pilot, who was steering the Pharaon towards the narrow entrance of the inner port, was a young man, who, with activity and vigilant eye, watched every motion of the ship, and repeated each direction of the pilot.";

// the key here is to allow for async, non-blocking processing while executing the callback only once, only once ALL async calls have completed.
// 
// Execute all of the following using JSONP with Jquery (or whatever you wish)

// 1. do a search on google for "twitter patients" (https://www.google.com/search?q=twitter+patients&safe=off)
// 2. for the first 10 of these, retrieve the twitter profile bio from their public profile page (twitter.com/{{handle}})
// 	a. the element to get is ".bio.profile-field"
// 3. as you get each of these, add them to the page, into a table with the following structure:
// 	<th>twitter handle</th>
// 	<th>twitter link</th>
// 	<th>twitter bio</th>
// 4. after all of these are retrieved and displayed, call a function into which you pass in the following data structure (JSON):
// 	a. make sure that the call contains data for all 10 twitter calls.
// 	[{handle: 'twitter handle', link: 'twitter link', bio: 'twitter bio'}, ...]
// 5. ensure that the last call is only called once, and only once all info has been both retrieved and output to the page.
